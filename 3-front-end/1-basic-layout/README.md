Basic Layout
============

Using HTML and CSS, you are going to construct a skeleton for basic webpage.

Create a header positioned absolutely to the top of the page. Use HTML 5 semantics, the `<header>` tag.

Put a h1 tag inside that says something funny.

Make a navigation bar, also positioned absolutely, that is colored black. Use HTML5 semantics, the `<nav>` tag.

Add a list of links to the navigation bar, colored white. Make working links to any websites you want. Turn off the text decoration so it looks cool.

Create a content area of the page, with a 1em margin below the nav bar. It should be 90% of the page width.

See if you can make two columns inside, spaced evenly side by side  

How about 3 columns inside?

Make a footer, positioned absolutely at the bottom of the page. Use HTML 5 Semantics.

Go into Dev tools and utilize the box model. Are your margins and spacing tight? What happens when you resize your window?
