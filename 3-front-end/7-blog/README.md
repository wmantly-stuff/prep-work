Make a Blog
===========

You're going to make a blog. [Github offers free hosting of one static page per account.](https://pages.github.com/)  
We're going to do it in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).  
Follow the steps on their [GitHub page](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).

When you make the repository for your Jekyll site, make sure to include the Jekyll gitignore.

Once you get the page up, feel free to customize it. Look through the layout of the framework. Play around with it and see what changes what.

Congratulations! You've used your first framework.

_Note_: This assignment is pretty open ended. Reach out to us, if you get stuck or feel lost.
