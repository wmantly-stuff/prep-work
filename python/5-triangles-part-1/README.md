####Print a Triangle

##Using nested for loops, print a triangle like so:

`*`  
`**`  
`***`  
`****`  
`*****`  
`******`  
`*******`  
`********`  
`*********`  
`**********`  

This triangle is 10 high, but I want the ability to make it as high as I want by setting one variable.

You can print this to the console or to the printout div.
