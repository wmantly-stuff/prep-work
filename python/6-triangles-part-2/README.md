Print a Mario End of Level Stairs
=======================================

Remember this from Mario?

###Create it!

		       ***

This triangle is 10 high, but I want the ability to make it as high as I want by setting one variable. You must print this in the console.

###Stretch
Make it awesome! Download some images and use jQuery to print them and get an actual set of mario stairs on the page. Feel free to remove the printout div or whatever you might have to do to make the images fit.
