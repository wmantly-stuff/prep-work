I'm Fizz Buzzing Bro

Write a function that takes a positive number, and returns you the sum of all multiples of 3 and 5, but not numbers that are multiples of 15. 

In Python, here is how we define a function:

		def multiples(num):
			algorithm ##indentation is mandatory
			return(sum) ##this is it, no closure!
