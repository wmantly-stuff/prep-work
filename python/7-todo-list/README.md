To Do List
==========

When it comes to learning new web languages, the todo list has become a "Hello World". So expect to revisit this in Python.

But until then, we will do it in front-end Javascript.

You will find the toDoList prototype and constructor at the top of the main.js file.

###Create the List

The add method adds a todo to the list, using the text input and form.  

The complete method marks the appropriate todo item complete. The user wants to click the item itself and strike the item, noting it done.  

Use toggle to toggle it done struck and unstruck.  

Feel free to add any other methods, lists or objects you may want. You will want a separate function to print the list to the #printout div.

###Woah! Client's demands have changed

Now the client who was going to buy your sweet todo list wants a new feature. Is it going to break your whole code, or is your code modular and extendable?

They want it so after a user completes a task, it is displayed struck for 10 seconds, but then disappears from your list. Google the setTimeout method.
