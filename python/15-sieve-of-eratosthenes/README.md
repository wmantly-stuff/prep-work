Sieve of Eratosthenes
=====================

The [Sieve of Eratosthenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) is an algorithm used to determine all the prime numbers below a given number.

###Pseudocode

Use the wikipedia explanation above (under the "Example" header) to write some pseudocode to solve this problem. Here is a [pseudocode refresher](http://www.unf.edu/~broggio/cop2221/2221pseu.htm). Write this in comments at the top of the sieve.py file.

###Solve in Python

Write a function that implements this algorithm to determine all the prime numbers below a given number. The program should take a number as an argument, and return an array of all the primes.
