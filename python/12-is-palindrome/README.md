Sarah Palindrome
================

Write a function that when given a word or sentence returns True if it is a palindrome and False if it isn't.

Your program should accept input using sys.argv.
```
python3 palindrome.py Taco Cat # returns true
```
You will want to make this case insensitive (Cat == cat). You can do this by make all letters upper or lower case.  
You will also want to use strip to remove all non word characters.

Make the asserts pass and write more assert statements to test your code.
