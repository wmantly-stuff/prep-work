Sarah Palindrome
============

Write a function that when given a word or sentence returns True if it is a palindrome and False if it isn't. 

Your program should accept input using sys.argv.

		python3 palindrome.py Taco Cat ###returns true

###OOP

Let's make sure this program adheres to good object oriented design. Your main function should ONLY check if it is a palindrome and return True or False. Any other functions you might need, like string operations - should be seperated. Every function should do only one thing.


Make the asserts pass and write more assert statements to test your code.
