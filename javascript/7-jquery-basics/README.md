####JQuery Basics

JQuery is a powerful front-end javascript library that is used on virtually 100% of modern websites. The JQuery codebase is extremely [well documented with explanations and examples](http://api.jquery.com/) Don't be afraid to dig in.

When you open index.html you'll find 3 black boxes, inside a 3 column layout.

Your task is the following:

* Add 3 buttons to each column, under the boxes and text. The buttons should be centered and evenly spaced. Label each button with a color of your choice.
* Using JQuery's .css method, change the color of the appropriate box to the color you labeled the button when the button is clicked.
* Also adjust the text under each box to tell the user which color the box currently is.
* Make it so when you click the box, it goes back to black and alters the message appropriately.
* Add another button for each box. Label it "Animate!" or whatever.
* Using JQuery's .animate method, make one box much taller, slowly. Make one box much skinnier, fast. And make one box completely disappear.
* Now make it so when you click the animate button a second time it will go back to the way it was.

This is just some of the fun you can have in JQuery. What else can you do?
