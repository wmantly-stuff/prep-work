### Intro to jQuery

In this assignment, you will be dynamically adding list elements with the comments from the form.  

The flow is something like this - the user writes in the form and presses the submit button. That text is added to the page, under the form. The page is not refreshed, and the user can continue to add items.

Research the following to accomplish this challenge.

jQuery .append  
Form inputs and how to access their values  
jQuery .on (in this assignment, you will be using .on('submit'))  
preventDefault
