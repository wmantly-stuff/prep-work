Hacker News  
===========

* Go to Y Combinator's [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).
* Check out the source code. It is minified, which makes load time faster, but difficult to read. Add the HTML to index.html and CSS to main.css Deminify it. Depending on your text editor, it might do it for you.
* Read through the code, and compare it to what you see on the page. What is each thing doing?
* What do you think of the embedded CSS? Is this good practice?
* Check out the CSS file. Does it follow DRY (don't repeat yourself) priniciples?
* Pick something in the site that you found interesting. Blog about it.
