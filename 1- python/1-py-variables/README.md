Python Variables, Lists and Dictionaries
========================================

Create a variable named byte and set it equal to "school".

Create a [list](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm) named instructors and have it contain the strings "Armen", "Chris", and "Greg"

Create an [tuple](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_tuples.htm) named students and have it contain the strings "Adolfo", "Benny", "Billy", "Brendan"

What's the difference between a list and a tuple? Why use one over the other?

Create a dictionary with the following key-value pairs- "byteAcademy":byte, "instructors":instructors, "students":students

Print the keys and values of the dictionary. It should look like this:
```
byteAcademy - School  
instructors - Armen, Chris, Greg  
students - Adolfo, Benny, Billy, Brendan
```
