Banks and Bank Accounts
=======================

Make a bank object that holds bank accounts. Your bank accounts should have a balance and account number (store the account number as a string).  
Make two bank accounts that are keys in the Bank object.  
With the bank accounts, you should be able to:  
* make a deposit
* make a withdrawal
* Not be able to withdraw more than the amount in the account
* See your current balance
