Get Prime Numbers Challenge
===========================

In the HTML file you'll find the normal template plus an input form.

Have the input form accept a number from the user. When the form is submitted, have the function getPrimes take the number as an argument (num) and calculate all the prime numbers up to and including num.

In typical fashion, use JQuery to have all the prime numbers append to the "#printout" div. Make sure they are wrapped in p tags for readability. Do not modify the HTML in any way.
